  Hard to imagine that a change from a slower machine to a faster one
  can have its disadvantages, too. You may find out for example, that
  certain graphic programs and games will suddenly stampede your
  screen and give you rather a vicious headache than visual pleasure.
  Run included oldtimer DAZZLER.COM on a fast machine to experience
  what I mean.

  Ironically enough, you may have a whole bunch of utilities to speed
  up the screen display, while you are desperately looking for one to
  calibrate speed down. So it goes...

  Then you remember vaguely, there has been around some utility for
  that purpose... Now you have ONLY to come up with the programs name:
  Was it Slow..? Calm..? Quiet..? No, much more common:

  If you have fast graphic programs, applications or demos without
  inbuild options or switches to regulate their speed, the TSR WHOA!
  can slow down them in most cases (see WHOA!.DOC). I'll add here some
  undocumented features:

  When WHOA! goes resident it will take about 20 Kb of RAM. Loading
  WHOA! successively twice the program comes up with the message
  "Uninstalled". Unfortunately this is not true, as every memory
  mapper will show. That's why I added MARK.COM and RELEASE.EXE to
  this package. Use these utilities in connection with WHOA! (and
  SLOWA) to free up memory consumed by these programs.

  Included DAZ12.BAT demonstrates, how DAZZLER.COM should be run with
  MARK and RELEASE, thus uninstalling WHOA! from memory after exit.

  The calibration speed for WHOA! is normally set via hotkey ALT-F10.
  However, settings straight from the command line are also possible
  (specially useful for batch files). Like this:

  WHOA! -435 ÕÕº  [slowest value]

  Included WHOA!.ZIP is the original up/downloadable package

  Brad Crandall wrote WHOA! for 12-MHz machines, and although the
  program works on faster machines as well, it doesn't slow down them
  enough. So I reassembled WHOA!.ASM on and for my 16-MHz machine in
  order to find out an appropriate optimum value for 16-MHz. After
  many trials (and rebootings) I winded up with a maximum value of
  -520 (slowest rate). This value decreases the speed of my system
  drastically; to disable SLOWA via hotkey ALT-F10 can take up to a
  minute ≠. For most graphic applications a value between -480 and
  -510 will do fine.

  I have tested SLOWA with several graphic applications and demos -
  with good results. If you have a 16-MHz machine use SLOWA instead of
  WHOA!. I don't know, whether and how SLOWA works on faster machines.
  If you operate a faster one use SLOWA on your own risks.

  Except for slower values SLOWA behaves the same way as WHOA!
  described above and in WHOA!.DOC. Use DAZ16.BAT as a demo and
  calibrate DAZZLER down to a level at your likings. DAZ16.DAT (or
  DAZ12.BAT) can easily be modified for other applications, just
  change the batch line

  to the name of your program. When running at an extreme slow level
  some applications tend occasionally to blank the screen. Pressing
  the space bar will keep them going in most cases.
