WHOA!.COM
"WHOA!" slowdown program

This is the runnable program file for "WHOA!," a memory-resident utility that
slows down the computer's execution speed. If you have a superfast AT, AT
compatible, or PS/2, you can slow it down to run games and other
time-critical programs at a manageable speed. If you don't have a computer
that's too fast, you may want to handicap the machine to gain an advantage
when playing certain games. "WHOA!" runs on any IBM PC, XT, AT, PS/2, or
compatible with at least 256K of memory and DOS 2.0 or higher. It is not
compatible with the IBM PCjr or with the advanced screen modes of the enhanced
graphics adapter (EGA). To install the program, enter WHOA! at the DOS prompt.
To call up WHOA! after it's installed, press Alt-F10.
